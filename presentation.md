# Diffusion.c presentation

## IDEA: make presentation

Stable diffusion is under-rated!

We were inspired by Karpathy's own AI-powered CUDA mode......

## PLAN: Execute 

The big idea: Implement diffusion.c

Stable diffusion, training and inference, implemented in C

Inspired by: llm.c

How?

1. Feed context for the LLM:
- 3 youtube videos from fastai:
  - Getting Started with CUDA for Python Programmers
  - Going Further with CUDA for Python Programmers
  - Lesson 9: Deep Learning Foundations to Stable Diffusion
- llm.c codebase (let Claude be inspired)
- pytorch diffusors implementation

2. generate a plan, work step by step

3. secret sauce

## RESULT: Show
